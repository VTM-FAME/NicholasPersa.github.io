Welcome to my web space!

### So what exactly is this?

A few years back, I picked up an Ipad mini for school. I used it to download PDFs, test out note taking apps, and read PowerPoints and ebooks. After getting used to doing my school work and research digitally, I found writing most things down on paper unmotivating. In fact, writing something down on paper and storing it in some dungeon of a file cabinet for limited access and future use seems like a tech-crime.

I am using this website to catalog ideas, notes, and other postings which I would normally record, organize and store more traditionally. Over time, I will experiment with the program code to design and develop some kind of virtual storage that has wide access across devices and easily presents the information I need on demand.
