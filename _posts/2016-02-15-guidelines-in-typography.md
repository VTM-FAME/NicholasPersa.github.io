## Just a few pointers from E.P.

- No low x-heights ([Apercu](https://www.google.com/search?q=apercu+font&espv=2&biw=1019&bih=877&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwjR1c2CzfrKAhXkmoMKHRNMCisQ_AUIBigB) is a good example, while [Futura](https://www.google.com/search?q=apercu+font&espv=2&biw=1019&bih=877&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0ahUKEwjR1c2CzfrKAhXkmoMKHRNMCisQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&q=futura+font) is not).
- Pair complementary typefaces (serif with sans serif not serif with serif).
- Aperatures (partially closed negative space), counters (closed negative space), and eyes ('e') need to be large enough ([eyes vs. counters](http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/typeanatomy/a/basic_anatomy.htm)).
- Look out for serifs, links (connecting bit 'g'), ears ('g' and 'n' tabs), and spurs (pointy bits on letters 'G').
- AVOID Helvetica, especially Neue.
