title: Direct Manipulation Animation
---

## Research by M. Chan & J. Black 2006

Issue: When forming mental models of systems, how do you support learner's understandings of structure, purpose and functional relations among system entities. 

Can a specialized version of animation provide a superior pathway to knowledge acquistion?

### Purpose of Research

Examine presentation formats -- narrative, image/visual, and animation to discover differences in learning systems.

### Secondary Goal

Show that text, visuals, and animation in a cohesive setup ultimately promotes superior learning.

### Leads
- Visuals aid printed word learning (Larkin & Simon, 1987; Mayer & Gallini, 1990; Tversky, 1995).
- Complex interactivity and content can overburden learner's cognitive resources (Sweller et al., 1996).
- Revisit and review the 3 pathways of learning and discussion on haptic learning consequences (above Fig. 1).

### Key Term

Direct-manipulation animation (DMA) allows direct interaction (e.g., sliders and buttons), which contrains viewing direction, content pacing, and system parameter relationships (Chan & Black, 2006). DMA specifically pertains to the haptic learning pathway (see lead 3). 

### Method

Middle school students learning Newtonian mechanics (energy conversion and law of conversion of energy) in three conditions. Learners were given a pretest, retention test (written summary and diagram), "what-if" test (thought experiment: explain and predict), near-transfer task (apply learning to problem-solving tasks), and a far-transfer task (apply learning in novel situation).

### Conditions
NVA
- Text based format (narrative).
- Text and visual format.
- Text and animation (DMA).

The format of the learning significantly predicted performance. Format had an above medium [effect size](http://www.uccs.edu/lbecker/effect-size.html) of .68. So DMA provided the best learning situation.
