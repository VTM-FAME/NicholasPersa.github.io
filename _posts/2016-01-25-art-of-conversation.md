## During a conversation

During a great debate/convo w my Sig, I got reprimanded for the way I went about talking. My tactic was to keep reiventing my argument's words and test the theories I was placing forth. I prefer, or am maybe use to the other person adopting the same strategy as myself. In this way, both parties keep thinking about their stance and how evidence or arguments support it.

However, my Sig did not mirror my stance and felt put off. Siggy recommended to echo back and reword what I was hearing. Siggy appreciated investigating the argument this way and felt more involved in the convo. As a great positive consequence from helping push the opposing view and interweave both parties' ideas, I was able to elaborate and disover from a new perspective.
