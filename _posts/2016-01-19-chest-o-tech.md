### [Hiq Lockscreen](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olyware.mathlock&hl=en)
I think I could make a cool mod of this for other useful data.

### [Yo app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_(app))
Sometimes really basic programs can have business applications. Try to think how you could streamline other products into business models.

### [DocentEDU](http://docentedu.com/)
What a gem! This is a really neat concept. Would my Noto share any features? How does their method differ from how I'd capture and arrange information?

### [Okeebo](https://www.okeebo.com/demo/)
Another diamond in the rough! An expandable book UI tree for literature. More information simply expands on demand. You can also make other connections that are only supported by virtual thinking.

### [Diigo](https://www.diigo.com/)
Another project related to Docent. Can I use this service as a backend for Noto? Or should I try to learn their implementation and fabricate my own tools?

### [Nudge](http://www.nudgeeducation.com/)
A collection of browser teacher tools design for classroom utility.

### Web APIs
