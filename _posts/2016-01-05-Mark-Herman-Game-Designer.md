## Listening to Podcast Designer Notes: Mark Herman

### Mark: 
The rules are on the cards ([MTG](http://magic.wizards.com/ "Magic The Gathering")) and the reduces the number of rules in the rulebook. [We the People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_the_People_(game)) used this to reduce the mental load for the players. This model gave them the information they needed when they needed it.

### Thoughts:
Can this be used in video games as well? Creating spaces where the rules are subject to change, and the new mechanics are defined within the novel environment. Or players are able to customize there experience and rules can easily be read by other players. This might be seen in League of Legened play?
