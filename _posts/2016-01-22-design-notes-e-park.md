## Transparency

When you are using a design, you look through the design while using it. There isn't a thought process to use the item, but it is natural. The design is transparent, your design is not invading the user's ability.

Imagine a wine glass. When filled, it's about the wine inside. The glass becomes out of focus. Its design does not impact the concept of the wine. Yet, when empty, the glass stands by itself: an object of beauty. 

A balance between appearance and disappearance.
