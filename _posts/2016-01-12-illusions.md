##Typing Game && Space Invaders

The other day I came across a [video on twitter](http://madewith.unity.com/stories/finding-voice-epistory-1) and I thought I had discovered gold! In this video, there was a game made with Unity3D where you could type words and then destroy approaching enemies.

Earlier this year I disovered a similar game called [ZType](http://zty.pe/).

Although the twitter game didn't exactly meet my expectations, it was completely different from ZType, I enjoyed reading the article about Epistory and the challenge of the game's story design.
