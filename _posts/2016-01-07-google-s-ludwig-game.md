## [The Musical Ludwig Game](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-ludwig-van-beethovens-245th-year)

I love the artwork of this simple logo-game. I think the artwork is actually made of paper scenes? And if it isn't "real," then it should have been. I like when designers pull in real world environments for their games. The added layer of depth grabs my attention and my actions feel more connected to that virtual space.

Here are two more examples of the technique. 

Here is [Lumino City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btpeCVRslFM); this is how they [built that world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO6t6H19CUk), and an [interview about the process](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/11/06/making-of-lumino-city/).

Here is [The Swapper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-hnhkrlqu0), and a small [write up about the title](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2013/11/13/245080686/in-space-no-one-can-hear-you-swap).
