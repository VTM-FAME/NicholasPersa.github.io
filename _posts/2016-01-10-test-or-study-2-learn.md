## [Research by J. Karpicke & H Roediger, 2008](http://public.wsu.edu/~fournier/Teaching/psych592/Readings/Karpicke_et_al_2008.pdf)

Contemporary view: tests are purely an assessment of knowledge (Karpicke, 2008)

What consequences does the act of testing knowledge have on learning?

Purpose of research: examine the effects of studying and testing on learning and long-term retention. 

Secondary goal: assess students perspective on their learning outcomes.

Method: Repeatedly study then test items. Three drop conditions for successfully recalled items:
	- dropped from study but still tested
    - dropped from test but still studied
    - dropped from test and study
