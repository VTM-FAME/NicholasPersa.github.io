## [Research by J. Karpicke & H Roediger, 2008](http://public.wsu.edu/~fournier/Teaching/psych592/Readings/Karpicke_et_al_2008.pdf)

Contemporary view: tests are traditionally seen as a pure and neutral assessment of knowledge (Karpicke & Roediger, 2008)

What consequences does the act of testing knowledge have on learning?

	Purpose of research: examine the effects of studying and testing on learning and long-term retention. 

	Secondary goal: assess students perspective on their learning outcomes.

Method: Repeatedly study then test items. Three drop conditions for successfully recalled items. One control condition. All learners then completed a final test one week later.

Conditions:
- Dropped from study but still tested
- Dropped from test but still studied
- Dropped from test and study
- All items studied and tested (control)

There were no differences between condition recall immediately after the learning phase. All learners had equal recall of the items. All learners also perceived that they would perfrom equally well during the final week delayed test.

### Testing items, rather than studying them, played an integral factor in generating long-term knowledge (Karpicke & Roediger, 2008).

Repeatedly studying items successfully recalled had no performance effect on the final week delayed test.
